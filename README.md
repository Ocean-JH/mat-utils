## Overview of Tools

### 1. Ternary Element Substitution Tool
The script collection automates the process of substituting elements in ternary systems, particularly useful for exploring new materials. It includes scripts to fetch prototype structures, perform element substitutions, generate permutations, and prepare calculation folders.
- `01_Prototype_MP_API.py`: Fetches prototype structure data via the Materials Project API.
- `02_element_substitution_GeSbTe.py`: Performs element substitution in the GeSbTe system.
- `03_element_permutation.py`: Generates permutations of elements within structures.
- `04_prep_calc_folder.py`: Prepares calculation folders and input files in batch.
- `05_data_postprocessing.py`: Post-processes and organizes calculation results.
- `Element Substitution Pipeline.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook integrating the element substitution workflow.

### 2. First-principles Computational Tensile Test (FPCTT) Model Generator
The script collection automates the setup of first-principles tensile tests, generating VASP input directories for various tensile distances based on an initial structure.
> For more details on the methodology, see [Bond mobility mechanism in grain boundary embrittlement: First-principles tensile tests of Fe with a P-segregated grain boundary | Phys. Rev. B](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.82.094108).
- `abinitio_tensile_test.py`: Main script for first-principles tensile test simulations.
- `POSCAR`: Initial structure file for calculations.
- `calc_folder/Distance_*/POSCAR`: Structure files for various tensile distances.
- `calc_folder/ini_structure/POSCAR`: Backup of the initial structure.

### 3. [USPEX](https://uspex-team.org/en) Helper
The script collection is designed to analyze and visualize results from USPEX crystal structure prediction calculations.
- `uspex_convex_hull_analysis.py`: Performs convex hull analysis on USPEX results.
- `uspex_poscar_splitter.py`: Splits USPEX output structures into individual POSCAR files.

### 4. [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/) Helper
The script collection assists with VASP (Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package) calculations, including analysis and preparation of input files.
- `vasp_analyzer.py`: Analyzes VASP calculation results.
- `vasp_preparer.py`: Prepares input files for VASP calculations.

### 5. Periodic Table Mapper
The script collection provides a mapping of element-wise data to their respective positions in the periodic table, enabling intuitive visualization and analysis of element-specific properties.
- `periodic_table_mapper.py`: Visualizes element-wise data on a periodic table layout, supporting raw or normalized values from dictionaries, DataFrames, or Series.

### 6. Symmetry Statistics
The script collection analyzes the symmetry operations of crystal structures, helping to identify and classify unique symmetry elements in point and space groups.
- `point_group_explorer.py`: Lists and analyzes symmetry operations for a specified point group.
- `symmetry_elements_explorer.py`: Identifies unique symmetry elements in point groups.
- `symmetry_operations_explorer.py`: Identifies unique symmetry operations (rotation and translation) from point/space group data.
- `site_symmetry_explorer.py`: Collects statistics on site symmetries of all Wyckoff positions.
- `symmetry_operations_interpreter.py`: Interprets the geometric meaning of symmetry operations (rotation, mirror, screw, glide, etc.) and provides details about their symmetry elements (axes or planes).
- `symop_converter.py`: Parses symmetry operation strings and converts between human-readable notation and affine matrix representations.

### 7. Structure Analyzer
The script collection provides a comprehensive analysis of specific crystal structures, especially on symmetry and Wyckoff sites.
- `site_env_analyzer.py`: Analyzes the local environment of sites in a crystal structure, providing insights into coordination and symmetry.
