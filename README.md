# Mat-utils
ðŸ“„ **Mat-utils** is a growing collection of small, practical Python scripts designed to assist with tasks in computational materials science and AI4S (AI for Science). This repository currently includes:

**First-principles Computational Tensile Test (FPCTT) Model Generator**: Automatically creates VASP input directories for [first-principles computational tensile tests][1].

**Ternary Element Substitution Tool**: Helps explore new material candidates by generating and analyzing substituted structures.

More tools will be added over time to streamline materials design, automate repetitive tasks, and support AI-driven research.
